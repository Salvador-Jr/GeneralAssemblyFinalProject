				<p>As a beginner I did not worry too much about getting the best equipment. I was more worried about the price since I was on a budget. Luckily i was bale to find a great deal during black friday. I started off with purchasing a Nikon D3300 bundel. The bundel came with the Nikon D3300 body, a 18-55mm wide lense, a 50-200mm telephoto lense, and a Wi-Fi adaptar. I spent about $600 total and was pretty happy with what I bought. </p>

				<p>After 2 years of learning how to ues the features on my camera I decided it was time to upgrade to new lenses. I spent about 3 months looking at deals and was able to find one that caught my eye. The bundle came with a macro lense and a fixed portrait lense. I spent about $500 in total. </p>
